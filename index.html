Step 2: Gather Assets

    Pick an external font for the ‘logo’ section. We’ve used 
    Norse Bold, but you can use any font you like.
    For the image-sidebar, we’ve used this Odin logo. Again, 
    feel free to replace it.

Step 3: Some Tips!

    How you attack this project is mostly up to you, but it 
    is wise to begin by scaffolding out the structure of the 
    page, and then tackle the various sections one by one.
    The area behind the “ODIN” logo is a div that has a dark, 
    but semi-transparent background color. This enhances the 
    readability of the text against the busy background image.
    The color we’ve chosen for the ‘Create Account’ button is 
    similar to tones found in the background image. Specifically, 
    it is #596D48.
    The inputs, by default have a very light border (#E5E7EB), 
    but we’ve included 2 variations. For starters, the password 
    inputs should be given an error class.
    The other variation is the selected input, which should 
    have a blue border and subtle box-shadow. This can be done 
    with the :focus pseudo-class you’ve learned about in an 
    earlier lesson.
    Do not worry about making your project look nice on mobile, 
    but DO resize your browser a little bit to make sure that 
    it’s not completely broken at different desktop resolutions.
    Checking that the password fields match each other requires 
    javascript. Try to implement this if you feel confident, 
    otherwise just validate each field separately.
